This is a repository documenting a reproducible analysis for a hypoerspectral experiment using 2 potato varieties as 2 different development times.  The goals of the experiment were:

- are there spectral difference between meristem and background vegetation for the varieties?

- are there spectral difference between meristem and background vegetation for the development times?
